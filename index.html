            History of <i><b><mark>Halloween</mark></b></i>!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Halloween is celebrated annually on October 31 and has its origins in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain. This festival marked the end of the
            <br>
            harvest season and the beginning of winter, a time when it was believed that the boundary between the living and the dead was blurred. People would light
            <br>
            bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts, reflecting their belief in the supernatural.
            <br>
            In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints, which incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening
            <br>
            before became known as All Hallows' Eve, eventually evolving into the term Halloween.
            <br>
            Over the centuries, Halloween has transformed into a largely secular celebration characterized by activities such as trick-or-treating, costume parties, and various
            <br>
            spooky-themed events.
            <br>
            Today, Halloween is celebrated in many countries, particularly in North America, where it has become a festive occasion filled with fun and creativity, often devoid of
            <br>
            its original religious significance.

            Why Do People Carve Pumpkins for <i><b><mark>Halloween</mark></b></i>?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Carving pumpkins, also known as jack-o'-lanterns, is a popular Halloween tradition with roots in Irish folklore.
            <br>
            Origins: The practice began with the Irish, who used turnips and other root vegetables to create lanterns to ward off evil spirits during Samhain. When Irish immigrants came
            <br>
            to America, they found that pumpkins, which were more abundant and easier to carve, made better lanterns.
            <br>
            Symbolism: The carved pumpkins were believed to represent protection against malevolent spirits. The light inside the pumpkin was thought to guide lost souls and keep them at bay.
            <br>
            Tradition: Today, carving pumpkins has become a fun and creative activity for families and communities. People often gather to carve intricate designs, with many displaying their creations
            <br>
            on porches or in windows during the Halloween season.
            <br>
            Cultural Impact: The jack-o'-lantern has grown to be a symbol of Halloween itself, representing the festive spirit of the holiday. Many communities host pumpkin carving contests, adding to the
            <br>
            excitement of the season.
            <br>
            In summary, carving pumpkins for Halloween is a tradition that blends historical practices with modern creativity, making it a beloved part of the celebration.
